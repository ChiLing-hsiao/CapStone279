Love this product", "This is NOT pink - it\u2019s orange.", "This cheek stick is absolutely GORGEOUS! It gives you that perfect flushed/coral cheek look and it blends like a DREAM! You can even wear it on a no make-up day. I am never disappointed by Charlotte Tilbury products and this is a MUST HAVE!", "I like the color Moon Beach, but I don\u2019t like the texture at all. Maybe I missed something here, or not using it correctly. I feel like I keep chewing on sand all day when I put it on my lips. When I use it as a blush, I feel like it\u2019s easily rubbed off with my fingers, and it still feels sandy on my cheeks even hours after I applied it. I don\u2019t know if I would pay a ton of money for this product again."], "date": ["14 Sep 2018", "22 d ago", "24 d ago", "20 Sep 2018"], "score": [5, 1, 5, 3], "title": ["NOT Pink!!!", "A MUST HAVE in your purse!", "Gorgeous glow!", "moon beach seems more like a highlighter for me"]}, "figure_URL": ["https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2116390-main-grid.jpg"], "id": 243, "mini_figure_URL": ["https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2116390-main-grid.jpg"], "name": "Beach Lip & Cheek Stick", "price": 45.0, "review_score": 3, "source": {"original_price": [45.0], "product_URL": ["https://www.sephora.com/product/beach-lip-cheek-stick-P434525?icid2=products grid:p434525:product"], "source": ["Sephora"]}}
