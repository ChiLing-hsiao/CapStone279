I've FINALLY found a lipstick that doesn't clump on me, wear out fast, or feel drying. I'm thinking of returning all of my Bite and NARS lipsticks so I can afford to replace them with YSL!!", "Fell in love with #70 Le Nu after trying it on at the store and ordered it online - so we can get our gift with purchase ladies!\n\nThe color is beautiful but all of these feel balmy and luxurious on the lips and provide great coverage. Not sure what the issue is with the smell that others have written about - I must not have that gene. Looking forward to its arrival.", "These were my first two YSL lip colors. I love them! The only complaint I have is the Fuscia can stain a little unless I apply a lip primer prior to application. Overall though, both are satin so they're moisturizing and a natural finish, not matte. They were long wearing, and very true-to-shade. (see picture for swatches but ignore the messy application, i didn't use a liner)"], "date": ["17 Oct 2016", "18 Nov 2015", "13 Dec 2015", "8 Oct 2015"], "score": [5, 5, 5, 5], "title": ["Have I finally found the one??", "beautiful", "shades 19 FUSCIA & 09 ROSE", "I Volunteer As (Beige) Tribute"]}, "figure_URL": ["https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s1500834-main-grid.jpg"], "id": 486, "mini_figure_URL": ["https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s1500834-main-grid.jpg"], "name": "ROUGE PUR COUTURE Lipstick Collection", "price": 38.0, "review_score": 4, "source": {"original_price": [38.0], "product_URL": ["https://www.sephora.com/product/rouge-pur-couture-lipstick-collection-P400701?icid2=products grid:p400701:product"], "source": ["Sephora"]}}
