Definitely recommend", "Really good foundation I like it a lot but sometimes it grabs to dry patches and kinda looks weird but overall a really good foundation you just have to moisturize a lot if you have dry skin", "I normally have combination skin, but this year has been extremely dry. So, I moisturize! Then I tried this foundation and my face did not respind well. The foundation felt as if it was running off and became very glossy. Not the natural look I was going for. Unfortunately, it also picked up on any facial flaw (pores, dry skin, wrinkles), most you can't normally see, unless I use this foundation.", "This is honestly the best foundation I have ever bought!
