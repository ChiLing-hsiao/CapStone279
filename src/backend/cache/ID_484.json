Love the color", "Swatched it at the store and immediately fell in love with the color! I ordered online bc the store was sold out. I had no problems with ordering online. It is very creamy and a liner is not necessary. I have several Chanel lipsticks and they do not compare to the YSL formula. The creamy-ness is what drove me to purchase this. I also got the color from the collection; Or Cuivre. The Le Rouge is a beautiful shade as well. I also fell in love with the packaging! The gold logo just makes it that much better. Get it before they discontinue the product!", "The most gorgeous, bold pink that you don\u2019t think you can pull off, but you CAN! I looked at this and thought, no way. The associate promised me it would look amazing on. So glad I listened to her! YSL Rouge Pur Couture is my favorite lip product and this is my favorite shade out of my collection. The formula is so rich and smooth, the pigment is incredible. Worth the price", "Color payoff is gorgeous! Creamy, rich and very good wear time. The packaging is luxe. I\u2019m so happy with this purchase!"], "date": ["11 Oct 2018", "6 Sep 2018", "14 Sep 2018", "20 Sep 2018"], "score": [5, 5, 5, 5], "title": ["Perfect nude", "Must Have!", "love hate !!!", "Beautiful Shade, creamy, non-drying"]}, "figure_URL": ["https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2111128-main-grid.jpg"], "id": 484, "mini_figure_URL": ["https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2111128-main-grid.jpg"], "name": "Rouge Pur Couture Limited Edition Lipstick", "price": 38.0, "review_score": 4, "source": {"original_price": [38.0], "product_URL": ["https://www.sephora.com/product/rouge-pur-couture-limited-edition-lipstick-P436050?icid2=products grid:p436050:product"], "source": ["Sephora"]}}
