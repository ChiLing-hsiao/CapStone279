However, like all make-up, it will look make-upy if it is layered too much.", "bought this product recently for the new year in hopes of finally finding a make up that makes my skin look even and so far i LOVE it. however, it is not make your skin \"flawless\" if you have a pimple or something you still need to use a concealer. Overall though, it really is a great product. My skin looks even and glowing and I have gotten many compliments.", "I've come back to this after about 3 years of not using it because I was trying other foundations and what not... why did I ever stop using this!? Omg I love it! I'll admit that at first it looks just a bit powdery on my skin but once I'm done doing my hair and rest of make up it has meshed perfectly with my skin and it looks amazing! Make sure you're taking your time to blend blend blend!", "This stuff is wonderful and it changed my makeup routine.

Best foundation I ever used couldn't stand the feel of wet foundation ever again \ud83d\ude03", "I use to really love wearing this as my only foundation, but now in my early 30s I just don't like the settling. Also, I don't know why but the colors I have always worn do not match my skin tone. I am very fair and even the lightest color appears orange.", "I use a Y6 morphe brush to buff onto my face. I've never tried the brush that is recommended for the product because I don't want to pay that much. The Y6 is like $8 at morphe and works well for me. I use bare minerals prime time primer first then put on concealer before the foundation. I've heard different recommendations with the product to put concealer before or after. I prefer before. \n*IMPORTANT* when running low you can open the bottom and get a few more uses. Use old tweezers to open it (if you use your ones you use regularly they will bend and get ruined) I've included a picture", "I have used this product for many years.
