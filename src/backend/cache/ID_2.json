{"brand": "Giorgio Armani Beauty", "comment": {"content": ["I bought this foundation in store, and I was using this religiously until it was almost done. I didn't realize until after I stopped using it that it was the cause of my random breakouts on my face.\nI have pretty clear skin with the rare breakout. But I thought it was strange that all of a sudden (around the time I started using this product) my skin was acting up.\n\nSince I have stopped using this foundation, my skin has cleared up and is back to its normal condition.\n\nI'm really disapointed. It's a great foundation, but maybe a little too thick and heavy for my liking. I usually diluted it with my everyday moisturizer to thin it out a little. But overall the finish was amazing!\n\nIf you're looking for a medium/high coverage foundation, then this product is probably for you. BUT beware if you have sensitive skin!", "Best foundation if you want a flawless look but you don't want to look cakey try this foundation!!! Worth the price", "I love everything Giorgio Armani. This was the first thing I purchased from this brand and immediately fell in love. I have dry skin with an oily t-zone and this did not intensify my oily t-zone. It is a beautiful medium coverage. When I wear it I always get compliments on my skin not my makeup!"], "date": ["20 Oct 2015", "25 Dec 2015", "19 Sep 2017"], "score": [3, 5, 5], "title": ["Great coverage but...", "eh", "One of my favorites"]}, "figure_URL": ["https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2079168-main-grid.jpg"], "id": 2, "mini_figure_URL": ["https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2079168-main-grid.jpg"], "name": "Luminous Silk Foundation", "price": 42.0, "review_score": 4, "source": {"original_price": [42.0], "product_URL": ["https://www.sephora.com/product/luminous-silk-foundation-P393401?icid2=products grid:p393401:product"], "source": ["Sephora"]}}
