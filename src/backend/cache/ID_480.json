Wish it would last longer.", "I own two of these, #11 and a violet one whose number has rubbed off. They are the best combination of a gloss and a stain that I have run across.\n\nI normally hate glosses because even the slightest bit of tackiness is enough to put me off, but I don't experience tackiness with these. They are also excellent stains and stay put for most of the day without drying out your lips. I've had people complement me on my red lipstick when I've worn #11 on its own. They do have a taste/smell of rose to them. I know this can be off putting to some people\n\nCons: The two colors I have can bleed a bit, so lining is a good idea\n\nWhen I tried on some of the lighter colors in store, it was hard to tell how well they showed up on me/stained my lips, so I can't speak for their staining power.", "Love this stain.
